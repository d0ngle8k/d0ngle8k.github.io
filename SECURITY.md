# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep this website and its users safe!

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

- **Email:** trggiathanh2003@gmail.com
- **GitHub Issues:** [Open an issue](https://github.com/d0ngle8k/d0ngle8k.github.io/issues) (for non-sensitive reports only)

Please include as much detail as possible, including:
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Potential impact
- Any suggested remediation

**Do not** publicly disclose vulnerabilities before they have been addressed.

## Responsible Disclosure

- Please allow a reasonable time for me to review and address the issue before any public disclosure.
- I am committed to investigating all reports and will respond as quickly as possible.
- If you wish to be credited for your discovery, let me know in your report.

## Security Practices

- This is a static portfolio site with a minimal backend (for chatbot only).
- No sensitive user data is collected or stored.
- All dependencies are kept up to date and monitored for vulnerabilities.
- The backend is protected with rate limiting and CORS.
- HTTPS is enforced for all public deployments.

## Scope

- This policy applies to the code and infrastructure in this repository only.
- Third-party services (e.g., EmailJS, Google Gemini API) have their own security policies.

## Out of Scope

- Social engineering attacks
- Denial of service (DoS) attacks
- Automated vulnerability scanners without prior notice

## Hall of Fame

If you responsibly disclose a valid security issue, you may be added to a public Hall of Fame (with your permission).
